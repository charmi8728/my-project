# 🌱 Soil Fertility Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a Machine Learning–based system to analyze soil parameters and predict soil fertility. It also provides fertilizer recommendations, crop yield estimation, soil health scoring, and soil degradation risk identification. The aim is to promote sustainable and data-driven agricultural practices.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Traditional soil testing methods are costly, time-consuming, and not easily accessible to farmers. Lack of proper soil knowledge leads to improper fertilizer usage and reduced crop yield. This project addresses these challenges by automating soil analysis using Machine Learning techniques.

---

## 🧠 Proposed Solution
The system uses supervised Machine Learning models trained on soil-related data. After preprocessing and feature scaling, the model predicts soil fertility and generates meaningful agricultural recommendations to assist farmers and planners.
